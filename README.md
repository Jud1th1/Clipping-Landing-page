My process
Built desktop first by using grid and flex
Formatted my html layout, added a stylesheet with colors and fonts according to the design sheet
Worked through the CSS from top to bottom then added media queries for 600px max
Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Desktop-first workflow
What I learned
I had trouble with my media query and realized that I was setting a fixed width which was making my grid unresponsive when shrinking. Also I think starting from a mobile first design would have been benefical and easier in this practice.

.wrkflow{
    border: 5px solid;
    border-image: linear-gradient(45deg,#FD7E3D, hsl(233, 100%, 69%),  hsl(171, 66%, 44%)) 1;
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    padding-top: 30px;
    padding-bottom: 30px;
}
